#### Steps:
##### Hosted Checkout
To initiate the hosted checkout process, send a POST request with the following parameters:

```json
{
    "amount":"1",
    "billref":"bill-reference",
    "productDescription": "Product Description"
}
```

Then, in your controller, use the following code:

```php
        $jazzcash = new JazzCash();
        $jazzcash->setAmount($request->amount);
        $jazzcash->setBillReference($request->billref);
        $jazzcash->setProductDescription($request->productDescription);
        return $jazzcash->sendRequest();
```
The index function is called and a new instance of the JazzCash class is created. The setAmount, setBillReference, and setProductDescription methods are called on the JazzCash object, passing in the amount, billref, and productDescription values from the request as arguments. These methods set the corresponding properties of the JazzCash object to the specified values.

The sendRequest method is called on the JazzCash object. This method sends a request to the JazzCash API to initiate the checkout process and returns the response from the API as an HTML template which can be rendered on the web and mobile application. To hide or show fields, you can use CSS to control the field's visibility on the frontend.

The response from the API is returned by the index function. This response can be used to display the hosted checkout form on your website or mobile app.

### Testing
To test the payment gateway, you can use the sandbox mode by setting `JAZZCASH_PAYMENTMODE=sandbox` in your `.env` file. This will allow you to test the checkout process without actually processing any payments.

To switch to production mode, set `JAZZCASH_PAYMENTMODE=production` in your `.env` file.
